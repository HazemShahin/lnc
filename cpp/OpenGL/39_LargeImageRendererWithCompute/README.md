This is a special version of the LargeImageRenderer-Code from Directory 38
it was put together to compare the fractal computed on the fly with the precomputed
hierachy version. If you just want to have fun with the mandelbrot set you can also define
COMPUTE_ONLY in LargeImage.h to completely disable reading form large images.
